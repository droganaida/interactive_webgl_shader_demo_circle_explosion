# Interactive WebGL + GLSL Demo, pure JavaScript, animation direction controlled by mouse clicks via manipulation of uniform variable inside shader code

## Live Preview
Experience the demo in action here: [Interactive WebGL Live Preview](https://droganaida.github.io/interactive_webgl_shader_demo_circle_explosion/).

This project is an interactive demonstration created using WebGL and the GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shader programming language.
The demo features particle explosion and implosion animation around a circle upon mouse click. The uniqueness of the project lies in the ability to change the animation direction through mouse clicks, allowing the user to interact with the effects in real-time.
The animation is achieved by manipulating a uniform variable inside the shader code, providing a smooth and responsive transition between animation states.

## Technologies:
- WebGL: Used for creating interactive 2D and 3D graphics applications in web browsers.
- GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language): Shader programming language enabling the creation of custom graphical effects in WebGL.
- Uniform Variables: Utilized for dynamically changing shader parameters in real-time, ensuring interactive animation.
- JavaScript: The project is developed entirely in pure JavaScript, without the use of external libraries, ensuring high efficiency and independence from external resources.

## Usage:
Click on the circle on the screen to witness the particle explosion and implosion animation. The animation direction changes with every mouse click.
